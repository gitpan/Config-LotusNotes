This directory contains files that pretend to be a notes install.
This allows the module to be tested on systems with no Notes installed.

- nlnotes.exe just has to be present, so it's an empty file.
- notes.ini just contains the keys needed for this module.
- nsd.exe is shortened just to the portion that contains the version string.
